# 🎗️ Cancer Awareness & Support

Cancer Awareness & Support is a thoughtfully designed web application created to spread awareness about cancer, encourage early detection, and remind people that no one has to face this journey alone.

This project focuses on empathy, clarity, and simplicity — combining meaningful content with a clean, modern user interface.

## 🌱 Why I Built This

Cancer is not just a medical condition — it affects emotional, mental, and social well-being.  
Through this project, I wanted to create a space that:

- Educates people about the importance of awareness  
- Encourages early action and informed decisions  
- Provides emotional reassurance through thoughtful design and words  

The goal was to build something simple, human, and impactful.
